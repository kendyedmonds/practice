# sUAS Data
A forum to enable discussion on best practices for scientific small Unmanded Aircraft Systems  (sUAS) metadata and data management.

We invite everyone interested in the use of sUAS (often termed 'drones') to comment on the issues and proposals presented here.  The goal is simply to enable a global community discussion that will lead to convergences on best practices to employ when capturing scientific data using sUAS.  The primary motivation for this being to equip the community with an accessible means of adopting good data management practices that result in the data being [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) to the benefit of the broader scientific community.
