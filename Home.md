# sUAS Data
We invite everyone interested in the use of sUAS (often termed 'drones') to comment on the issues and proposals presented here.  The goal is simply to enable a global community discussion that might lead to convergences on best practices to employ when capturing scientific data using sUAS.  The primary motivation being to equip the community with an accessible means of adopting good data management practices that result in the data being [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fair) (**F**indable **A**ccessible **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable).

#### A Note on Scope
This wiki attempts to provide guidelines to enable good data management by sUAS users.  Consequently, the focus is on flight-granularity and first level data (see issue for data level definition discussion).

To clarify, we are not currently exploring guidelines for:
1. higher level data product management, or
1. how to perform sensor calibration, sampling and flight procedures.

However, we recognise these as significant issues. Feel free to engage further with us via the RDA group [mailing list](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems%E2%80%99-data-ig) and [read](https://www.rd-alliance.org/blogs/drones-emerging-scientific-tools-trade.html) about other groups we're engaged with working on these and other issues.
