## _in situ_ measurements
Proposal: Follow the [underwater glider community](https://github.com/ioos/ioosngdac) and utilise [netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/user_guide.html) with custom conventions \([Join the discussion](https://github.com/RDA-sUAS-Data-IG/sUASData/issues/3)\)

### Advantages of netCDF
* Independent of computer architecture - hassle-free sharing between platforms
* Self-describing - ancillary information and metadata can be included in the same file as the data
* Flexible - can hold arbitrarily large arrays (netCDF-4) with an arbitrary number of dimensions (scalars are treated as 0-dimensional arrays)

### NetCDF-4
There are three versions of the netCDF file format: netCDF classic, netCDF with 64bit-offset and netCDF-4. The latest version, netCDF-4, has been released in 2008 and provides a bunch of advantages over the earlier formats (virtually unlimited size of variables, transparent compression, support for non-rectangular arrays through multiple unlimited dimensions etc.). NetCDF-4 is therefore proposed as the preferred container format for sUAS data.


## Remote and proximal sensing
The data generated by a remote sensing device often has the form of a series of images. These can be stored as multidimensional arrays in a single file (e.g. a netCDF file), but maybe a collection of files in a more traditional format such as TIFF plus a file containing metadata and additional non-image data would be much more practical?
