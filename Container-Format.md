### _in situ_ measurements
Proposal: Follow the underwater glider community and utilise a [custom NetCDF format](https://github.com/ioos/ioosngdac)

### Remote and proximal sensing
The data generated by a remote sensing device often has the form of a series of images. These can be stored as multidimensional arrays in a single file (e.g. a NetCDF file), but maybe a collection of files in a more traditional format such as TIFF plus a file containing metadata and additional non-image data would be much more practical?
