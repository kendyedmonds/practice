## _in situ_ measurements
Proposal: Follow the [underwater glider community](https://github.com/ioos/ioosngdac) and utilise [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/) with custom conventions \([Join the discussion](https://github.com/RDA-sUAS-Data-IG/sUASData/issues/3)\)

### Advantages of NetCDF
* Independent of computer architecture - hassle-free sharing between platforms
* Self-describing - ancillary information and metadata can be included in the same file as the data
* Flexible - can hold arbitrarily large arrays (netCDF-4) with an arbitrary number of dimensions (scalars are treated as 0-dimensional arrays)


## Remote and proximal sensing
The data generated by a remote sensing device often has the form of a series of images. These can be stored as multidimensional arrays in a single file (e.g. a NetCDF file), but maybe a collection of files in a more traditional format such as TIFF plus a file containing metadata and additional non-image data would be much more practical?
